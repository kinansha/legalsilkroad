# Legal Silk Road is an Ecommerce app that lets  users buy and sell items for a fixed price. The user creates an account with the App and register as a Seller or a Buyer. 
Once you register,a user can switch between being a Buyer and a Seller as needed without creating two seperate accounts.

The home page displays all items availble to sell in a random order.

The user can select a selling item category and the app will display items pertainting to that category.

Clicking on the login tab on Home page will direct user to a login page.

This page has the option to login as a  Buyer, Seller or register as a new user. 

Seller page item input form: 
  Photo of item: 
  Title: 
  Description of Item: 
  Category : (a drop down menu to select from)
  Price: 
  
Once an item is sold, it will be removed from the inventory and database will be updated as necessary.

The sellers page will have two tabs
  1. Items to sell
  2. Items sold.

Once a buyer purchases an Item, it will move from "Items to sell page" to "Items sold" page.
